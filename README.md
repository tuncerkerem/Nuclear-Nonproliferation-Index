# Nuclear Maps of the World

As part of the Columbia Center for Nuclear Studies, I devised a methodology to score countries by their nuclear program status, nuclear weapons count, defense spending score, nuclear weapons treaty count, nuclear energy safety treaty count, and nuclear energy usage. The end product was an interactive R Shiny dashboard that is on display on the Center's official website.

The live R Shiny dashboard can be found [here](https://kt2716.shinyapps.io/nuclearproj/). You can learn more about Center [here](https://k1project.columbia.edu/content/nuclear-maps-world).

In this repository, you can find the code for the R Shiny dashboard and the supporting dataset.
